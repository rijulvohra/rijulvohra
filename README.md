Hi everyone! I am [Rijul](https://rijulvohra.github.io/rijulvohra/)

I am a huge fan of making computers learn complex tasks. My interests range from machine learning, Natural Language Processing, and creating a knowledge base through information retrieval, entity resolution.
I would be happy to connect with you to talk about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Graphs or AI in general.

I am always looking to collaborate on exciting projects.
